### Hi there 🖖

* 🚀 I'm proud of my two "[One](https://github.com/chrschorn/oneclick-send-to-trello)-[Click](https://github.com/chrschorn/one-click-ticktick)" Chrome extensions that have around 1000 weekly active users (and counting), improving their productivity in small but meaningful ways!
* 🐱‍👤 Large C++ and Python projects I'm working on are all company-internal, so unfortunately not public
* 🏠 For more personal information and cool milky way photos, visit my [homepage](https://schorn.me/)!
