### Hi there!

* Have a look at my two "[One](https://github.com/chrschorn/one-click-trello)-[Click](https://github.com/chrschorn/one-click-ticktick)" Chrome extensions that have around 4500+ weekly active users, improving their productivity in small but meaningful ways!
* Large C++ and Python projects I'm working on are all company-internal, so unfortunately not public
* For more personal information and cool milky way photos, visit my [homepage](https://schorn.me/)!
